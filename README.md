Features
User Registration: Secure user registration with form validation.
Frontend Design: Responsive UI built with Bootstrap and custom CSS.
Backend Integration: Spring Boot backend to handle user data and potential banking features.
JavaScript Validation: Client-side form validation for username, email, and password fields.
Maven Project: Use Maven for project management and dependency handling.

Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up the project locally.

Prerequisites
Java (JDK 8 or higher)
Maven (for managing project dependencies)
IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse)
MySQL or H2 database for backend storage (if required)
Steps
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/online-banking-system-website/online-banking-management-system.git
cd online-banking-management-system
Build the Project: Use Maven to build the project.

bash
Copy code
mvn clean install
Run the Spring Boot Application: After building, run the Spring Boot application:

bash
Copy code
mvn spring-boot:run
The application will be accessible at http://localhost:8080.

Access the User Management Page: Open the browser and navigate to:

bash
Copy code
http://localhost:8080/user-management
You'll see the user registration form.

Database Setup:

Configure the database in the application.properties file in the src/main/resources folder.
Example (for H2 database):
properties
Copy code
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:mem:testdb
spring.datasource.driverClassName=org.h2.Driver
spring.datasource.username=sa
spring.datasource.password=password
spring.jpa.database-platform=org.hibernate.dialect.H2Dialect
Frontend and Backend Integration:

Once the backend is set up, extend it to handle form submissions, store data in the database, and provide user authentication.
Running Tests
Unit Tests: You can write unit tests for your controllers, services, and repositories. Maven has support for running unit tests.

bash
Copy code
mvn test
Integration Tests: Test the integration between backend and frontend by running the full application in the local environment.

Future Enhancements
Login and Authentication: Integrate Spring Security for login functionality.
Banking Features: Add features such as account creation, money transfers, transaction history, and balance management.
User Profiles: Allow users to update their profile details.
Error Handling: Improve error handling and user experience.
